Library <b>Modelica_LinearSystems2</b> is a Modelica package
providing different representations of linear, time invariant differential and
difference equation systems, as well as typical operations on these
system descriptions. Additionally, data structures and operations for
Complex numbers and for Polynomials are provided. These are utilized
above, but are, of course, also useful for other purposes.

<p>
In this section, a first introduction to the Modelica_LinearSystems2
library is given at hand of several examples.
The library consists of four main parts that
are described in the following sections:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Section <A HREF="Modelica_LinearSystems2_UsersGuide.html#Modelica_LinearSystems2.UsersGuide.GettingStarted.ComplexNumbers"
>Complex numbers</a>
     introduces the Modelica_LinearSystems2.Math.Complex record that provides a
     data struture for Complex numbers and arrays and also the most
     important (scalar) operations on them. Read this section first,
     because the structuring of records as well as operator overloading
     is explained that is also the basis for the other parts of the
     library.</li>

<li> Section <A HREF="Modelica_LinearSystems2_UsersGuide.html#Modelica_LinearSystems2.UsersGuide.GettingStarted.Polynomials"
>Polynomials</a>
     describes the Modelica_LinearSystems2.Math.Polynomials record that
     provides a data structure for Polynomials with real coefficients
     and operations such as evaluation, fitting, integration.
     The Complex and Polynomial data structures are basic
     building blocks for the other parts of the library.</li>

<li> <A HREF="Modelica_LinearSystems2_UsersGuide.html#Modelica_LinearSystems2.UsersGuide.GettingStarted.LinearSystemDataStructures"
>Linear system data structures</a>
     are records on the top level of Modelica_LinearSystems2 that define
     data structures for different representations of
     linear, time invariant, continuous and discrete systems,
     e.g., record StateSpace. Furthermore, operations are provided
     on these data structures, e.g., to connect linear systems together
     or plot a frequency response.</li>

</ol>

<p>
<b>2. Grant of Copyright License.</b> Licensor grants You a
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for
the duration of the copyright, to do the following:</p>

<ol>
 <li><p>
 To reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of
 a collection.</li></p>
 <li><p>
 To create Derivative Works according to Section 1d) of this License.</li></p>
 <li><p>
 To distribute or communicate to the public copies of the <u>Original
 Work</u> or a <u>Derivative Work</u> under <u>this License</u>. No
 fee, neither as a copyright-license fee, nor as a selling fee for
 the copy as such may be charged under this License. Furthermore, a
 verbatim copy of this License must be included in any copy of the
 Original Work or a Derivative Work under this License.<br>      For
 the matter of clarity, it is permitted A) to distribute or
 communicate such copies as part of a (possible commercial)
 collection where other parts are provided under different licenses
 and a license fee is charged for the other parts only and B) to
 charge for mere printing and shipping costs.</li></p>
 <li><p>
 To distribute or communicate to the public copies of a <u>Derivative
 Work</u>, alternatively to Section 2c), under <u>any other license</u>
 of your choice, especially also under a license for
 commercial/proprietary software, as long as You comply with Sections

 as to a selling fee for the copy as such apply.</li></p>
 <li><p>
 To perform the Original Work publicly.</li></p>
 <li><p>
 To display the Original Work publicly.</li></p>
</ol>

<p>
<b>3. Acceptance.</b> Any use of the Original Work or a
Derivative Work, or any action according to either Section 2a) to 2f)
above constitutes Your acceptance of this License.</p>

<p>
<b>4. Designation of Derivative Works and of Modified Works.
</b>The identifying designation of Derivative Work and of Modified
Work must be different to the corresponding identifying designation
of the Original Work. This means especially that the (root-level)
name of a Modelica package under this license must be changed if the
package is modified (besides fixing of errors, adding vendor specific
Modelica annotations, using a subset of the classes of a Modelica
package, or using another representation, e.g. a binary
representation).</p>

<p>
<b>5. Grant of Patent License.</b>
Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license,
under patent claims owned by the Licensor or licensed to the Licensor by
the owners of the Original Work that are embodied in the Original Work
as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents,
to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work
and Derivative Works under the conditions as given in Section 2.
For the matter of clarity, the license regarding Derivative Works covers
patent claims to the extent as they are embodied in the Original Work only.</p>

<p>
<b>6. Provision of Source Code.</b> Licensor agrees to provide
You with a copy of the Source Code of the Original Work but reserves
the right to decide freely on the manner of how the Original Work is
provided.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the matter of clarity, Licensor might provide only a binary
representation of the Original Work. In that case, You may (a) either
reproduce the Source Code from the binary representation if this is
possible (e.g., by performing a copy of an encrypted Modelica
package, if encryption allows the copy operation) or (b) request the
Source Code from the Licensor who will provide it to You.</p>

<p>
<b>7. Exclusions from License Grant.</b> Neither the names of
Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor
any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or
promote products derived from this Original Work without express
prior permission of the Licensor. Except as otherwise expressly
stated in this License and in particular in Sections 2 and 5, nothing
in this License grants any license to Licensor&rsquo;s trademarks,
copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual
property, and no patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer
for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No license is granted to the trademarks of
Licensor even if such trademarks are included in the Original Work,
except as expressly stated in this License. Nothing in this License
shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms
different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise
would have a right to license.</p>

<p>
<b>8. Attribution Rights.</b> You must retain in the Source
Code of the Original Work and of any Derivative Works that You
create, all author, copyright, patent, or trademark notices, as well
as any descriptive text identified therein as an &quot;Attribution
Notice&quot;. The same applies to the licensing notice of this
License in the Original Work. For the matter of clarity, &ldquo;author
notice&rdquo; means the notice that identifies the original
author(s). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative
Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice
reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the
Original Work. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case the Original Work or Derivative Work is not provided in
Source Code, the Attribution Notices shall be appropriately
displayed, e.g., in the documentation of the Derivative Work.</p>

<p><b>9. Disclaimer
of Warranty. <br></b><u><b>The Original Work is provided under this
License on an &quot;as is&quot; basis and without warranty, either
express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of
non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular
purpose. The entire risk as to the quality of the Original Work is
with You.</b></u><b> </b>This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an
essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is
granted by this License except under this disclaimer.</p>

<p>
<b>10. Limitation of Liability.</b> Under no circumstances and
under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor, the owner or a licensee
of the Original Work be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect,
general, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
character arising as a result of this License or the use of the
Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability
shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such
limitation.</p>

<p>
<b>11. Termination.</b> This License conditions your rights to
undertake the activities listed in Section 2 and 5, including your
right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and
doing so without observing these terms and conditions is prohibited
by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is
intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations. This License
shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the
rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to observe
the conditions of this license.</p>

<p>
<b>12. Termination for Patent Action.</b> This License shall
terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the
rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an
action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor,
any owners of the Original Work or any licensee alleging that the
Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall
not apply for an action alleging patent infringement through
combinations of the Original Work under combination with other
software or hardware.</p>

<p>
<b>13. Jurisdiction.</b> Any action or suit relating to this
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein
the Licensor resides and under the laws of that jurisdiction
excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to
the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the
appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination
of this License.</p>

<p>
<b>14. Attorneys&rsquo; Fees.</b> In any action to enforce the
terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs
incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such
action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p>

<p>
<b>15. Miscellaneous.</b>
</p>
<ol>
 <li>If any
 provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
 provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
 enforceable.</li>

 <li>No verbal
 ancillary agreements have been made. Changes and additions to this
 License must appear in writing to be valid. This also applies to
 changing the clause pertaining to written form.</li>

 <li>You may use the
 Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by
 this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with
 or be responsible for such uses by You.</li>

Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<p>This
section contains questions/answer to users and/or distributors of
Modelica packages and/or documents under Modelica License 2. Note,
the answers to the questions below are not a legal interpretation of
the Modelica License 2. In case of a conflict, the language of the
license shall prevail.</p>

<p><b>What are the main
differences to the previous version of the Modelica License?</b></p>
<ol>
 <li><p>
 Modelica License 1 is unclear whether the licensed Modelica package
 can be distributed under a different license. Version 2 explicitly
 allows that &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; can be distributed under
 any license of Your choice, see examples in Section 1d) as to what
 qualifies as Derivative Work (so, version 2 is clearer).</p>
 <li><p>
 If You modify a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (besides
 fixing of errors, adding vendor specific Modelica annotations, using
 a subset of the classes of a Modelica package, or using another
 representation, e.g., a binary representation), you must rename the
 root-level name of the package for your distribution. In version 1
 you could keep the name (so, version 2 is more restrictive). The
 reason of this restriction is to reduce the risk that Modelica
 packages are available that have identical names, but different
 functionality.</p>
 <li><p>
 Modelica License 1 states that &ldquo;It is not allowed to charge a
 fee for the original version or a modified version of the software,
 besides a reasonable fee for distribution and support<SPAN LANG="en-GB">&ldquo;.
 Version 2 has a </SPAN>similar intention for all Original Work under
 <u>Modelica License 2</u> (to remain free of charge and open source)
 but states this more clearly as &ldquo;No fee, neither as a
 copyright-license fee, nor as a selling fee for the copy as such may
 be charged&rdquo;. Contrary to version 1, Modelica License 2 has no
 restrictions on fees for Derivative Work that is provided under a
 different license (so, version 2 is clearer and has fewer
 restrictions).</p>
 <li><p>
 Modelica License 2 introduces several useful provisions for the
 licensee (articles 5, 6, 12), and for the licensor (articles 7, 12,
 13, 14) that have no counter part in version 1.</p>
 <li><p>
 Modelica License 2 can be applied to all type of work, including
 documents, images and data files, contrary to version 1 that was
 dedicated for software only (so, version 2 is more general).</p>
</ol>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) as part of my commercial
Modelica modeling and simulation environment?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
according to Section 2c). However, you are not allowed to charge a
fee for this part of your environment. Of course, you can charge for
your part of the environment.
</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different
license?</b></p>
<p>No.
The license of an unmodified Modelica package cannot be changed
according to Sections 2c) and 2d). This means that you cannot <u>sell</u>
copies of it, any distribution has to be free of charge.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license
when I first encrypt the package?</b></p>
<p>No.
Merely encrypting a package does not qualify for Derivative Work and
therefore the encrypted package has to stay under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license
when I first add classes to the package?</b></p>
<p>No.
The package itself remains unmodified, i.e., it is Original Work, and
therefore the license for this part must remain under Modelica
License 2. The newly added classes can be, however, under a different
license.
</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2)
and include it </b><u><b>unmodified</b></u><b> in a Modelica package
under a </b><u><b>commercial/proprietary license</b></u><b>?</b></p>
<p>No,
according to article 2c). However, you can include model, block,
function, package, record and connector classes in your Modelica
package under <u>Modelica License 2</u>. This means that your
Modelica package could be under a commercial/proprietary license, but
one or more classes of it are under Modelica License 2.<br>Note, a
&ldquo;type&rdquo; class (e.g., type Angle = Real(unit=&rdquo;rad&rdquo;))
can be copied and included unmodified under a commercial/proprietary
license (for details, see the next question).</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a type class or </b><u><b>part</b></u><b> of a model, block,
function, record, connector class, out of a Modelica package (under
Modelica License 2) and include it modified or unmodified in a
Modelica package under a </b><u><b>commercial/proprietary</b></u><b>
license</b></p>
<p>Yes,
according to article 2d), since this will in the end usually qualify
as Derivative Work. The reasoning is the following: A type class or
part of another class (e.g., an equation, a declaration, part of a
class description) cannot be utilized &ldquo;by its own&rdquo;. In
order to make this &ldquo;usable&rdquo;, you have to add additional
code in order that the class can be utilized. This is therefore
usually Derivative Work and Derivative Work can be provided under a
different license. Note, this only holds, if the additional code
introduced is sufficient to qualify for Derivative Work. Merely, just
copying a class and changing, say, one character in the documentation
of this class would be no Derivative Work and therefore the copied
code would have to stay under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2)
and include it in </b><u><b>modified </b></u><b>form in a
</b><u><b>commercial/proprietary</b></u><b> Modelica package?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
If the modification can be seen as a &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo;,
you can place it under your commercial/proprietary license. If the
modification does not qualify as &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; (e.g.,
bug fixes, vendor specific annotations), it must remain under
Modelica License 2. This means that your Modelica package could be
under a commercial/proprietary license, but one or more parts of it
are under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
&ldquo;save total model&rdquo; under my commercial/proprietary
license, even if classes under Modelica License 2 are included?</b></p>
<p>Your
classes of the &ldquo;save total model&rdquo; can be distributed
under your commercial/proprietary license, but the classes under
Modelica License 2 must remain under Modelica License 2. This means
you can distribute a &ldquo;save total model&rdquo;, but some parts
might be under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) in encrypted form?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
Note, if the encryption does not allow &ldquo;copying&rdquo; of
classes (in to unencrypted Modelica source code), you have to send
the Modelica source code of this package to your customer, if he/she
wishes it, according to article&nbsp;6.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute an
executable under my commercial/proprietary license, if the model from
which the executable is generated uses models from a Modelica package
under Modelica License 2?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
according to article 2d), since this is seen as Derivative Work. The
reasoning is the following: An executable allows the simulation of a
concrete model, whereas models from a Modelica package (without
pre-processing, translation, tool run-time library) are not able to
be simulated without tool support. By the processing of the tool and
by its run-time libraries, significant new functionality is added (a
model can be simulated whereas previously it could not be simulated)
and functionality available in the package is removed (e.g., to build
up a new model by dragging components of the package is no longer
possible with the executable).</p>

<p><b>Is my modification to
a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) a Derivative Work?</b></p>
<p>It
is not possible to give a general answer to it. To be regarded as &quot;an
original work of authorship&quot;, a derivative work must be
different enough from the original or must contain a substantial
amount of new material. Making minor changes or additions of little
substance to a preexisting work will not qualify the work as a new
version for such purposes.

<p>This
section is devoted especially for the following applications:</p>
<ol>
 <li><p>
 A Modelica tool extracts information out of a Modelica package and
 presents the result in form of a &ldquo;manual&rdquo; for this
 package in, e.g., html, doc, or pdf format.</p>
 <li><p>
 The Modelica language specification is a document defining the
 Modelica language. It will be licensed under Modelica License 2.</p>
 <li><p>
 Someone writes a book about the Modelica language and/or Modelica
 packages and uses information which is available in the Modelica
 language specification and/or the corresponding Modelica package.</p>
</ol>

<p><b>Can I sell a manual
that was basically derived by extracting information automatically
from a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (e.g., a &ldquo;reference
guide&rdquo; of the Modelica Standard Library):</b></p>
<p>Yes.
Extracting information from a Modelica package, and providing it in a
human readable, suitable format, like html, doc or pdf format, where
the content is significantly modified (e.g. tables with interface
information are constructed from the declarations of the public
variables) qualifies as Derivative Work and there are no restrictions
to charge a fee for Derivative Work under alternative 2d).</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under Modelica
License 2) and use it </b><u><b>unmodified</b></u><b> in my document
(e.g. the Modelica syntax description in the Modelica Specification)?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
In case you distribute your document, the copied parts are still
under Modelica License 2 and you are not allowed to charge a license
fee for this part. You can, of course, charge a fee for the rest of
your document.</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under Modelica
License 2) and use it in </b><u><b>modified</b></u><b> form in my
document?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
the creation of Derivative Works is allowed. In case the content is
significantly modified this qualifies as Derivative Work and there
are no restrictions to charge a fee for Derivative Work under
alternative 2d).</p>

<p><b>Can I sell a printed
version of a Modelica document (under Modelica License 2), e.g., the
Modelica Language Specification?</b></p>
<p>No,
if you are not the copyright-holder, since article 2c) does not allow
a selling fee for a (in this case physical) copy. However, mere
printing and shipping costs may be recovered.</p>

This library is implemented with Modelica 3.1 (especially the
operator overloading features are utilized) and requires the
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/clapack/CLAPACK-3.1.1-VisualStudio.zip">LAPACK 3.1.1</a> object library.
Furthermore, linearization and plotting is implemented
with Dymola API calls. It is planned to move these tool specific calls to the
ModelicaServices</a> package
(introduced for the Modelica Standard Library 3.1 for these
purposes), in order that other Modelica tools can provide the same functionality in a clean way.

<li> Some functionality of Modelica_LinearSystems2 (e.g.,
     linearizing a Modelica model by
     Modelica_LinearSystems2.StateSpace.Import.fromModel)
     has been originally developed by Sven Erik Mattsson
     from Dynasim.</li>
<li> The Math.Complex, Math.Polynomial, and
     TransferFunction packages are based on
     proposals from Hilding Elmqvist, Dynasim, presented at
     the 33rd Modelica design meeting in Bielefeld (Nov. 2003) and
     the 37th Modelica design meeting in Lund (Jan. 2004).</li>
<li> Several functions of package Complex have been provided
     by Anton Haumer, who also performed a thorough
     test of the package. </li>
<li> The design of the records (such as Math.Complex and
     Math.Polynomial) has been inspired by the discussions
     about operator overloading at various Modelica design
     meetings.</li>
<li> Advice for implementation issues given by Hans Olsson
     from Dynasim, as well as advice for some numerical algorithms
     given by Andras Varga and Dieter Joos from DLR is appreciated.</li>

     PAPAS (Plug-And-Play Antriebs- und Steuerungskonzepte f&uuml;r
     die Produktion von Morgen; F&ouml;rderkennzeichen: 02PH2060) is
     highly appreciated.</li>
<li> Since Oct. 2007, the library development was partially funded by BMBF within the
