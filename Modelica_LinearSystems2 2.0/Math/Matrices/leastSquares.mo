<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
A linear system of equations A*x = b has no solutions or infinitely
many solutions if A is not square. Function \"leastSquares\" returns
a solution in a least squarse sense:
</p>
<pre>
  size(A,1) &gt; size(A,2):  returns x such that |A*x - b|^2 is a minimum
  size(A,1) = size(A,2):  returns x such that A*x = b
  size(A,1) &lt; size(A,2):  returns x such that |x|^2 is a minimum for all
                          vectors x that fulfill A*x = b
</pre>
<p>
Note, the solution is computed with the LAPACK function \"dgelsx\",
i.e., QR or LQ factorization of A with column pivoting.
If A does not have full rank,
the solution is not unique and from the infinitely many solutions
the one is selected that minimizes both |x|^2 and |A*x - b|^2.
