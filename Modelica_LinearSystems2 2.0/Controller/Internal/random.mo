<i>Random</i> generates a sequence of uniform distributed
pseudo-random numbers. The algorithm is a variant of the
multiplicative congruential algorithm, known as the
Wichmann-Hill generator:
<pre>    x(k) = (a1*x(k-1)) mod m1
    y(k) = (a2*y(k-1)) mod m2
    z(k) = (a3*z(k-1)) mod m3
    U(k) = (x(k)/m1 + y(k)/m2 + z(k)/m3) mod 1
</pre>
This generates pseudo-random numbers U(k) uniformly distributed
in the interval (0,1). There are many forms of generators depending
on the parameters m (prime numbers) and a. The sequence needs an
initial Integer vector {x,y,z} known as the seed. The use of the same
seed will lead to the same sequence of numbers.
</p>
<p>
<b>Remarks</b>
</p>
<p>Random number generators (RNG) are pseudo-functions which are not true
functions but algorithms which deliver a fixed sequence of (usually Integer) numbers
which should have a very large period before they repeat itself and
appropriate statistic properties such that the sequence appears to be
a random draw. For real-valued random numbers, the integers are scaled to
the real interval 0.0-1.0. They result in a uniformly distributed random variate
between 0-1, which has to be tranformed to give a random variate of a wanted
distribution. There are two types of techniques for transforming random variates:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Acceptance-Rejection techniques</li>
<li>Transformation techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>Acceptance-Rejection techniques throw away some of the generated variates and are thus less efficient. They can not be avoided for all distributions. A good summary about random number generation and most of the transformation techniques used below is given in:</p>

        In order to completely avoid external functions, all seeds are
        set via parameters. For simulation purposes this is almost
        always the desired behaviour.
